I haven't done it through LuCI, but it's easy enough from a shell. Download routers.zip from purevpn to get the Wdc.key and ca.crt. Create a tunnel interface and create a forward from your lan in the firewall. I use the following openvpn config:

client 
float 
dev tun 
proto udp 
remote fastest-usserver.ptoserver.com 53 
persist-key 
persist-tun 
ca ca.crt 
tls-auth Wdc.key 1 
cipher AES-256-CBC 
comp-lzo 
verb 1 
mute 20 
route-method exe 
route-delay 2 
auth-user-pass authuser 
auth-retry interact 
ifconfig-nowarn 
auth-nocache
